Credit Risk Classification

Overview
This project applies machine learning to classify credit risk. The goal is to train and evaluate models that predict whether a loan application falls into high or low credit risk categories.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is lending_data.csv, which includes financial details of loan applications. The target variable is loan_status, which classifies loans as either high or low risk.


Steps in the Notebook
Load Data: Import and explore the dataset.
Preprocessing: Split data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train multiple machine learning models.
Evaluation: Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Running the Notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook and run the credit_risk_classification.ipynb file step by step to execute the analysis.

Results
Evaluates different machine learning models for credit risk classification.
Compares performance metrics to identify the best model.
